# WeatherWear v2 — Project Context for AI Assistants

## This is the canonical system

**weatherwear-v2** is the active, canonical codebase for the Smart Wardrobe Avatar project.

> `style-smart` (omerebay2002-a11y/style-smart) is the **old prototype** — frozen, no longer active.
> Do NOT import from it, sync with it, or reference its logic. It exists for historical reference only.

## What this app is

A smart virtual wardrobe with three connected panels:

| Panel | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Avatar** | User uploads a selfie → personalized avatar that wears outfits |
| **Wardrobe** | 3D virtual closet (Three.js cabinet), user manages clothes, sees them on avatar |
| **My Day** | Daily planner + calendar integration, suggests outfits by schedule + weather + events |

The three panels work together: **My Day drives the decision → Wardrobe supplies the outfit → Avatar wears it.**

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **3D:** Three.js + React Three Fiber (3D wardrobe cabinet)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet/Haiku) via Vercel Edge Functions (`/api`)
- **Weather:** Open-Meteo API (no API key needed)
- **Voice:** Web Speech API — Hebrew (`he-IL`)
- **Storage:** localStorage (client-side, no backend DB)
- **Deploy:** Vercel

---

## MVP Goal

All three panels functional and connected. No backend database required — localStorage is enough for MVP.
